# InfoOven
Chrome Extension that allows you to set up information radiators on large screens.

InfoOven is the worlds most powerful information radiator chrome extension on the planet. Ok. It is also probably the only information radiator chrome extension on the planet, but alas if there were more I'd like to imagine this one would be the best. Or above average at least. Maybe?


InfoOven allows you put your important information in multiple chrome tabs. It is configurable to rotate through those tabs to radiate this information to your teams. 


Primary tabs: Primary tabs are the left-most tabs in your Chrome windows. You can configure more primary tab windows below. These windows display for the length of time specified in hte Primary Refresh Interval below.


Secondary tabs: Secondary tabs are the remaining tabs in your Chrome windows that are not Primary tabs. These Secondary tabs are also configurable in how long they display below using hte Secondary Refresh Interval below.


Refresh intervals: Both Primary and Secondary tabs can also be configured to be refreshed using the Primary and Secondary Refresh Interval settings below. 


Window type: InfoOven can be configured to run on all open Chrome Windows, only the Focused Chrome Window, or only the Background Windows.


Auto Start: InfoOven can be configured to automatically start up when the browswer loads.
